Create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.
• The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.
The client takes two parameters:
◦ The server PID.
◦ The string to send.
The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.
Once the string has been received, the server must print it
